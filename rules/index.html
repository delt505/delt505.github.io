    minimaps, TNT timers, better F5 mods (allowing camera manipulation while movement remains static), world downloaders,
    and mods that disable chat reports. Mods or features that automate player actions, whether they are Minecraft
    modifications, external software, or hardware, are also strictly prohibited. This includes auto/burst clicking buttons
    or macros, auto-movement mods, and aim assists.</p>

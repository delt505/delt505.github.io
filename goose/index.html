        <p style="color: white;">I got banned by goose?</p>
        <p style="color: white;">who is goose?</p>
        <p style="color: white;">Goose Brigade, or simply Goose, is our anticheet responsible for sniffing out cheaters on our network. It keeps a watchful
        eye on all players and is quick to identify any irregularities or suspicious behavior that could indicate an unfair
        advantage.
        
        If Goose catches someone in the act of cheating, it logs the player's data for further investigation and potential
        consequences. Depending on the severity of the infraction, the player may be immediately removed from the game or face
        punishment at a later time.
        
        Now, to address your inquiry about your ban, Goose discovered that you were engaging in one or more forms of
        unfair advantage. This included actively using such advantages on the network, running a mod that was transmitting
        irregular data to the server, or employing a macro or AutoClicker tool. We take cheating very seriously here, but fear
        not, Goose is always on the lookout to ensure a fair and fun gaming experience for all.</p>

        <p style="color: white;">False bans can sadly happen. if this happened appel the punishment.</p>
